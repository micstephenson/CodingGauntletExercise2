So we need a new a console app but i would like you to start with a github repo.
 
within that we need to make a branch called main. 
 
Then take a feature branch off of main. 
 
Then the next task is inheritance: 
 
I would like 3 classes creating :
 
BaseBankAccount, CurrentAccount, SavingsAccount. 
 
The base bank account should have more common methods functions such as GetBalance() and Balance as these are used by all types of accounts. 
 
The classes CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount should inherit the BaseBankAccountClass
 
A list of multiple accounts should be made
 
This list is then looped though and the balance is displayed for each account, including the account name 
 
Once the task is done i want you to make a pull request and put that link here. 
 
note: we want to ensure all classes are in separate files, named correctly. 
note: if you havent done inheritance a go before - give it a try first, but be sure to timebox it

Part 3:
Linq 
 
1) Where balance > 2000
2) Where Balance < 2000
3) first/firstordefault
 
What is the difference?
1 - Returns all the accounts where the balance is greater than 2000
2 - Returns all the accounts where the balance is less than 2000
3 - First returns the first account that matches the criteria, if none found it throws an exception. FirstOrDefault returns the first account that matches the criteria, if none found it returns null (or default value for value types).
 
single account with specific account name using that 
 
Seperatley 
Order by account balance Ascending
Order by account balance Decending
 
All should be new lists 
 
Loop through and display each one 
 
Example:
ConsoleWriteline(----------Ordered Desc ----------------); 
// loop code to display
ConsoleWriteline(----------end ----------------); 
 
Needs to be in a feature branch taken off of main.
