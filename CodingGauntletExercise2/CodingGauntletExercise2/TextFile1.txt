So we need a new a console app but i would like you to start with a github repo.
 
within that we need to make a branch called main. 
 
Then take a feature branch off of main. 
 
Then the next task is inheritance: 
 
I would like 3 classes creating :
 
BaseBankAccount, CurrentAccount, SavingsAccount. 
 
The base bank account should have more common methods functions such as GetBalance() and Balance as these are used by all types of accounts. 
 
The classes CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount should inherit the BaseBankAccountClass
 
A list of multiple accounts should be made
 
This list is then looped though and the balance is displayed for each account, including the account name 
 
Once the task is done i want you to make a pull request and put that link here. 
 
note: we want to ensure all classes are in separate files, named correctly. 
note: if you havent done inheritance a go before - give it a try first, but be sure to timebox it
